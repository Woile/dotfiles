dotfiles
========

My personal dotfiles
Dotfiles represents how you customize your shell.
I have written/added few customization to my shell since years ago. Many times I have reused them in different systems so I decided to create a repository and share with everyone.
My aims IS NOT compare this project with another ones around there instead I just want to keep my stuff organized. 

There are a LOT of awesome *frameworks* to customize your shell such as bash-it, oh-my-zsh, etc, they have inspired me to do the job.

# dotfiles

My personal dotfiles
Dotfiles represents how you customize your shell.
I have written/added few customization to my shell since years ago. Many times I have reused them in different systems so I decided to create a repository and share with everyone.
My aims IS NOT compare this project with another ones around there instead I just want to keep my stuff organized.

There are a LOT of awesome _frameworks_ to customize your shell such as [bash-it](https://github.com/revans/bash-it), [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), [more](http://dotfiles.github.io/), they have inspired me to create this project with my personal stuff.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/malderete/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install
```

If you want to skip the GIT configuration you could set two ENV variable before install dotfiles.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/malderete/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
export DOT_GIT_AUTHORNAME='Your Name'
export DOT_GIT_AUTHOREMAIL='yourEmail'
./install
```
